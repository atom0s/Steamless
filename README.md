# Steamless

Steamless is a DRM remover of the SteamStub variants.

The goal of Steamless is to make a single solution for unpacking all Steam DRM packed files. Steamless aims to support as many games as possible.<br>
However, due to personal limited funds, I cannot test every game myself.


# What Steamless Wont Do For You

Steamless removes the SteamStub DRM protection from games that have it, nothing more.<br>
If the game you are unpacking makes use of the Steamworks API, Steamless **WILL NOT** remove this layer of DRM.

  * Steamless will not remove the Steamworks API integrations in any game.
  * Steamless will not handle CEG (Custom Executable Generation) DRM that is used by some games.
  * Steamless is not made to assist with piracy.
  * Steamless is not made to assist with bypassing anti-cheats or other protections.
  
This project makes static analysis on the games files that are protected with SteamStub possible.<br>
Will this allow some games to run without Steam? Yes. But I do not promote piracy and will not help with it at all.

Do not contact me or any contributor to this project with assistance on how to make a game work without Steam.

# What is SteamStub DRM?

```
Steamworks Digital Rights Management wraps your game's compiled executable and checks to make sure that it is running under an authenticated instance of Steam. This DRM solution is the same as the one used to protect games like Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source. Steamworks DRM has been heavily road-tested and is customer-friendly. 
In addition to DRM solutions, Steamworks also offers protection for game through day one release by shipping encrypted media to stores worldwide. There's no worry that your game will leak early from the manufacturing path, because your game stays encrypted until the moment you decide to release it. This protection can be added to your game simply by handing us finished bits or a gold master.

# Compiling Steamless

Steamless is coded using Visual Studio 2015 (Update 3) at this time.<br>
To compile, you should only need to load the sln file and compile as-is.

No changes should be needed to the solution or source.

I welcome and encourage contributions to the Steamless project. However, I do have some guidelines I wish for people to follow when doing so.

  * Please follow the similar coding style / naming conventions found in Steamless already.

  * Please do not alter or remove any copyrights without a discussion prior.
  * Please do not hard code information specific to any one target. Steamless should be dynamic full all titles.
